# Image-Colorizer

Colorizing grayscale images using an encoder-decoder neural network trained on the COCO dataset.

This project was developed as part of the Vision and Cognitive Systems course at the University of Padova.

Evaluates different model configurations, highlights challenges like color bias, and proposes improvements through guided or interactive methods.

Based on the paper [Deep Koalarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03400).
